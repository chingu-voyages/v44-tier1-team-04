## Overview
---
The Array Game is designed to help early learners build and expand on their multiplication skill for the numbers 1-6. Players use a simple grid that visually represents the calculation. <br>

This app was created for the Chingu voyage v44. 
## Description:
---
<p> Multiplication facts can be represented as an array.  An array is a rectangular or sqaure arrangement of objects, counters or tiles in equal rows. The game reinforces the array model of multiplication. This game can be played many times and will support students to gain confidence in using the array model for multiplication and to discover that the order in which two numbers are multiplied does not affect the product, this is the commutative property/law.[1]</p>

- [ ] You may **_NOT_** use AI-base solution generators like GitHub CoPilot.
- [ ] Useful links and resources:
    - [The Array Game](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/array-game/)

#### Styling

- [ ] Surprise us!!!
- [ ] Add a footer containing a link to your teams GitHub repo
- [ ] In general, you will find these [UI design principles](https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/principles) helpful.
- [ ] Recommend using this resource for [clean CSS](https://www.devbridge.com/articles/implementing-clean-css-bem-method/)

#### Functionality

-   User can see the game window with these components
    - Leaderboard showing the number of games the current player has won and lost
    - Game controls
    - A 10x10 grid the game is played on

- Leaderboard
    -   [ ] User can see the display of the total number of wins and losses for each 
    -   [ ] User can see the tally of wins for each of the three ways the game
    can end
    -   [ ] User can see the tally of losses for each of the three ways the game
    can end

- Game Controls
    -   [ ] User can see a button in the game control panel to start a new game, which updates the Leaderboard, clears the grid, and starts a new game.
    -   [ ] If the user tries to start a new game while one is in progress a modal alert will be displayed to confirm that the current game may be abandoned.
    -   [ ] When a game is started the user will see a button to roll the dice
    -   [ ] After rolling the dice a new roll will be blocked until the new 
    array has been marked on the grid by clicking squares in the grid
    -   [ ] User can see a the value of each dice after they are rolled
    -   [ ] The user will see a button to allow them to clear the grid and 
    to start refilling it using the values from the current roll. This allows
    the user to try different options.
    -   [ ] The user will see a button that allows them to submit their answer
    after filling in the grid from the current roll of the dice.

- Grid
    -   [ ] When the dice are rolled the user will be able to click on squares
    to mark their array.
    -   [ ] When a square is clicked it's color will change from the color used
    for unoccupied squares to the color designation for occupied squares.
    -   [ ] If the total number of squares marked on the grid don't match the
    numbers on the dice an error message must be issued and the user should be
    given the option to re-mark the grid to match the dice.

### Extras (Not Required)

-   [ ]  Implement the game to allow human-to-human competition between 2 
players or human-vs-computer competition.
-   [ ]  Allow the user to choose the color to be used to fill in the grid
-   [ ]  Maintain player metrics across sessions for the last 3 games that have 
been played
-   [ ]  Allow the user to specify the dimensions of the grid 
-   [ ]  Add a countdown timer showing time remaining in the game and create an
input field to allow the user to set the starting number of minutes and seconds.
-   [ ]  Animate the rolling of the dice
-   [ ]  Play a sound to simulate the rolling dice
-   [ ]  Add a graph to the leader board to show the number of times a number
has been rolled.
-   [ ]  Support dark/light mode
